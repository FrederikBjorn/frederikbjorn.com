<h3>Working with Google resonance in Fmod</h3>

A small walking simulator exploring different possibilities with the ambisonic format using Google resonance.
It was made as a part of an exam in 3D audio at Sonic College. I made all the audio using Fmod and integrated the sounds in Unity.

<h3>En stenet affære</h3>

A game I made as a part of an exam in Game Audio at Sonic College.
It is made in Unity using FMOD as middleware for integration of sound.
Since I made it all by myself, it was a great way to learn how to use Unity and understand the process of
making games from the perspective of every diciplines.
